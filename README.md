Restarting From Scratch on Retirement Portfolio Website

  Will be improving on the site with the following:
      1) Will be using the notika respository as inspiration, and making use of code where appropriate
          https://github.com/puikinsh/notika/tree/master
      2) Will be making better use of a true API that I'm also working on in a different repo
          https://github.com/tenbackdev/invest_REST_API
      3) Will look to transition graphics out of D3.js and into something else like Vue / Angular
